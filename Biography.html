<h2> The Basics </h2>

<p>My name is Sabrina Marie Seibel and I was born and raised in Georgia, I am now attending Georgia Tech as a Computer Science major! </p>

<h2> My interests </h2>

<p> I am involved in many places around campus including Project Rise Up, Sisters Rise Up, the Invention Studio, and Barbell Club. </p>

<p> Project Rise Up and Sisters Rise Up are two projects I work on at Georgia Tech. Project Rise Up is designed to encourage minorities in Computing fields and Sisters Rise Up is to get females in Computing fields. We host in-person sessions monthly, webinars twice a week, and tutoring sessions to help these students reach their potential! </p>

<p> I am a prototyping instructor for Georgia Tech's Invention Studio. The Invention Studio is a student-run makerspace that gives students the oppurtunity to make their ideas a reality by providing resources for designing, prototyping, and sharing their ideas. The Invention Studio is staffed by protyping instructors, like myself, who help train students on machines and help them on their projects.</p>

<p> Georgia Tech Barbell Club is a community of gym goers who enjoy lifting. We have a competitive powerlifting team and I am currently training to compete in the fall. </p>
